# Development
- Start by creating index HTML and its styling which will be same for both the ways of color flip.
- Create JavaScript which picks random color in case of pre-selected color generated and modifies the DOM element to change the background color to the random color picked from array. This is done by using even listener for click even on the button.
- For hex code generator, create a duplicate of index file and name it as hex.html
- Javascript involves picking a random number from array which concatenates together to form a hex code. This is then displayed as background color using an eve listener for click event on the button.
